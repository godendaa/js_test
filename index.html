		<h1>Comute.IT Javascript Test</h1>
		<p>Results are logged to Console</p>
		<h2>Assumptions / Notes</h2>
		<p>1.3: Array is not sorted after new element is added.</p>
		<p>
			1.4: logged out results for all items as 1.5 requires the same result as
			1.4 but 1.5 asks for 1.2 and 1.3
		</p>
		<p>
			1.5: An extra object will exist where added in 1.4. Comment out 1.4 to
			avoid newObj being added twice.
